# spring-core-ioc-demo
This repository demonstrates the core concepts of Inversion of Control (IoC) in Spring Framework. It provides examples of how to manage object creation and dependencies using Spring's IoC container.

## Overview

Inversion of Control (IoC) is a design principle in which the control of object creation and management is transferred from the application code to a container or framework. Spring's IoC container provides a powerful way to manage your applicationâ€™s components, making it easier to develop and test.

## Features

- Dependency Injection (DI) through constructor and setter methods
- Component scanning and automatic bean registration
- ApplicationContext examples

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java 8 or higher
